Unofficial Lockly API Documentation
===================================

Welcome to the Unofficial Lockly API Documentation!

This is an ongoing effort to document the various `Lockly <https://lockly.com.au>`_ APIs, with the goal of
enabling the development of projects such as:

- An alternative, cross-platform app capable of using both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to
  communicate with locks
- A `Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io>`_ integration
